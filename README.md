This project was created in order to create an accessible version of Dr. Siegfried's Inaccessible website: https://home.adelphi.edu/~siegfried/cs575/575Project/ 

This project uses javascript, react bootstrap, css, and react styled elements.
Accessibility checkmarks include: all images have alt tags, proper color schemes are employed, grammar changes were made, navbar buttons are assigned an aria role = "button", the navigation is also assigned an aria role = "navigation", etc.

Requirements were met by utilizing: http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/

Bootstrap also ensures an efficient way for web developers to create accessible websites across all devices used.

The accessibility of this site can be checked using Waivtool.
