This project was created in order to create an accessible version of Dr. Siegfried's Inaccessible website: https://home.adelphi.edu/~siegfried/cs575/575Project/ 

This project uses javascript, react bootstrap, css, and react styled elements.
Accessibility checkmarks include: all images have alt tags, proper color schemes are employed, grammar changes were made, etc.

Bootstrap also ensures an efficient way for web developers to create accessible websites across all devices used.

The accessibility of this site can be checked using Waivtool.
